# Unit2 Project - The Cook Buk

The Cook Buk application is a great way to store all your favorite recipes and even enjoy some of our own!


## Getting Started

All you need to access and use the application is a reliable internet source and device to browse the web.


## Deployment

Simply click on this link: https://thecookbuk.herokuapp.com/ and you're in!


## User Story

A user would start by clicking the link or navigating to the home page via url. Upon landing on the page they would have the option of immediately signing up for a profile, which then takes them to the index of all the recipes or simply clicking the logo in the top left to access them without a user profile.

When you browse the recipes, there will be little to no functionality unless you create a user profile. Once you do so and sign in, there will now be the options to save a recipe and the your recipes button in the top left will now appear.

Once the user saves a recipe they will be able to go back and edit it without editing the original index, as it saves as an object in their user document in the database. Besides editing you may also remove them from your recipes. Lastly anyone can add a recipe to the app, but only I can remove them or edit them to be displayed in the featured index.

The aim is to have each user try a couple new recipes out, save the ones they like to their profile, and possibly get creative and add a few of their own. It's an open source cook buk!
